# Some Future Plans

- Run physics calculations on client by using a sceduling algorithm (probably weighted round robin) to assign a client a frame, then the locations of the objects are sent to the server which sends those locations to the clients which updates them
- Switch ReactPhysics3D for Urho3D all around, on the client and running headless on the server
